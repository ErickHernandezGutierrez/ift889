Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a tractometry analysis brings together the outputs of tractography
 and advanced metrics from local diffusion models to get a measurement of
 the physical properties of brain tracts.
 Thus, tractometry is an important utensil to study the brain and neurodegenerat
ive diseases.
 However, the current tractometry frameworks are based on metrics derived
 from single tensor or fixel-based metrics derived from methods other than
 dMRI.
 Besides, there are several challenges facing researchers who use tractometry
 such that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Need of cutting edge multi-shell acquisition schemes of dMRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are many ways to model or represent dMRI data.
 This includes different sophisticated local diffusion models at the level
 of individual voxels, and different parameters configurations of the same
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tracking techniques to reconstruct the WM fascicles, which involves a large
 number of parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robust multi-parameter approaches to classify whole brain tractograms into
 major WM fascicles.
 These fascicles are hard to define and recover robustly because they have
 variable spatial extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjustment of all involved parameters to apply dMRI tractometry beyond phantoms,
 i.e.
 in real life applications like MS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-shell dMRI is now widely used.
 Nonetheless, the most appropiate representation and modeling of multiple
 fascicles traversing the same voxel remains unclear.
 Simple models like DSI and QBI do not make assumptions on the dMRI data
 and are sensitive to fiber crossing, but they focus on describing the general
 shape of the diffusion profile in each voxel instead of representing each
 fixel independently, and therefore they do not enable characterization
 of each individual fixel.
 On the other hand, spherical deconvolution methods provide fixel-based
 metrics and orientations, but they are not capable of proving metrics like
 fixel-RD, which is ideal for MS applications as it aims of be characterize
 the demyelination.
 In addition, advanced local diffusion models like MRDS and DIAMOND that
 allow to estimate fixel-based dMRI metrics are still slow and inefficient.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tractometry analysis informed with fixel-based dMRI metrics needs to be
 translated to MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, and this is still
 a very important open problem.
 That's why it is important to study a tractometry pipeline informed with
 fixel-based dMRI metrics like fixel-RD, which aims to achieve the crossing
 fiber limitations of dMRI metrics derived from single tensor.

Besides, despite the notable available tractometry pipelines in the state-of-the
-art, methods that use dMRI metrics like RD, AD, FA and MD are derived from
 single tensor.
 The metrics usually extracted from DTI tend to lack specificity to characterize
 the underlying microstructure, and are very sensitive to white matter anomalies

 However, it is now very well-known that FA is not specific, i.e.
 several different microstructure scenarios may lead to the same FA, see

It is thus clear that each fascicle that traverses a voxel should have its
 diffusivities (fascicle-MD, fascicle-AD and fascicle-RD) and fiber-specific
 FA (fascicle-FA), which is recently also coined fixel-based FA (a fixel
 is a fiber element)

Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main objective is to setup a robust (to noise and crossing fibers) pipeline
 for the automatic extraction and statistical analysis of track-specific
 white matter measures, which will be useful in MS to characterize demyelination.
 Estimated fixel-based orientations and metrics will be used as indirect
 proxies to axon loss, demyelination and neuroinflammation.
 In particular, we envision that the fixel-based RD (fixel-RD) could help
 to account for demyelination

\begin_layout Standard
In order to achieve our main objective, we will face several challenges.
 The first one is to select a method to estimate the fixel-based dMRI metrics.
 Both MRDS and DIAMOND can estimate fixel-based dMRI profiles.
 But we decided to use the MRDS method instead of DIAMOND to estimate the
 fixel-based dMRI metrics.
 MRDS is a simpler model than DIAMOND when representing the dMRI data.
 However, MRDS needs less parameters compared with DIAMOND.
 Thus, we have the hypothesis that MRDS is a viable trade-off between complexity
 and number of parameters for clinic data.
 Besides, MRDS has been shown to be more robust to noise than DIAMOND when
 estimating the orientations of the fixels

.
 On the other hand, CSD is not an option in this case as it is unable to
 estimate fixel-RD metrics.
 On the whole, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 main problems that have to be addressed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fast, accurate and robust (against noise and fiber crossing) estimation
 of fixel-based dMRI metrics from the dMRI data using the multi-tensor based
 method MRDS.
 This, by itself, implies several challenges:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Improve the model selector in MRDS to better estimate the number of tensors
 per voxel.
 MRDS tends to overfit the number of tensors per voxel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Parallelization of MRDS using modern GPU parallel programming techniques
 to ensure fast fitting of the MRDS method to the dMRI data.
 Currently, MRDS faces long fitting times.
 For some real human brain data sets it takes 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 entire days for fitting a single brain, using modern CPU with tens of cores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Validate the new model selector and the parallelization implementation using
 synthetic phantoms.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Multimetric analysis of white matter tracts in different fiber bundles.
 It's required to adapt the tractometry_flow pipeline to integrate the fixel-bas
ed MRDS metrics into the statistical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Build and validate a new tractometry pipeline with MRDS and tractometry_flow
 by adding the previous improvements and including other steps based on
 methods in the state-of-the-art that we will describe in the next chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform a MS study by applying this new pipeline.
 Although this new pipeline for automating tract-profiling in the white
 matter could improve brain connectivity mapping through crossing fiber
 regions and pathologies in the human brain, we will focus to demostrate
 the application of our pipeline to relapsing remitting MS with a unique
 acquisition paradigm of 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 timepoints over 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 months with MS-based dMRI and myelin-based MRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, together the optimizations for MRDS in points 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 will result in a journal publication.
 Besides, the pipeline resulting pipeline in point 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 will generate another journal publication.
