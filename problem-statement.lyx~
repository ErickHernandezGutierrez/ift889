Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a tractometry analysis brings together the outputs of tractography
 and advanced voxel-wise local diffusion models, which allow to use fixel-based
 metrics to study the brain and neurodegenerative diseases.
 However, there are several challenges facing researchers who use tractometry
 such that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Need of cutting edge multi-shell acquisition schemes of dMRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are many ways to model or represent dMRI data.
 This includes different sophisticated local diffusion models at the level
 of individual voxels, and different parameters configurations of the same
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tracking techniques to reconstruct the white matter pathways, which involves
 also a large number of parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robust multi-parameter approaches to classify whole brain tractograms into
 major white matter bundles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adjustment of all involved parameters to apply tractometry in real life
 applications beyond phantoms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-shell dMRI is now widely used.
 Nonetheless, simple models like DSI, QBI, and CSD focus on describing the
 general shape of the diffusion profile in each voxel instead of representing
 each fixel independently, and therefore they do not enable characterization
 of each individual fixel.
 In addition, advanced local diffusion models that allow to estimate fixel-based
 metrics are still slow and inefficient.

\begin_layout Standard
Although RD is suggested as the closest biomarker of demyelination

\end_inset

, none of them have proven to be a specific imaging biomarker of myelin.
 Besides, despite the notable available tractometry pipelines in the state-of-th
e-art, methods that use dMRI metrics like RD, AD, FA and MD are derived
 from single tensor.
 The metrics usually extracted from DTI tend to lack specificity to characterize
 the underlying microstructure, and are very sensitive to white matter anomalies

].
 It is thus clear that it is important to study a tractometry pipeline informed
 with fixel-based dMRI metrics like fixel-RD, which aims to achieve the
 crossing fiber limitations of single tensor derived dMRI metrics.
 Fixel-based analysis needs to be translated to neurodegenerative diseases
 and this is still a very important open problem.

 However, it is now very well-known that FA is not specific, i.e.
 several different microstructure scenarios may lead to the same FA, see

It is thus clear that each fascicle that traverses a voxel should have its
 diffusivities (fascicle-MD, fascicle-AD and fascicle-RD) and fiber-specific
 FA (fascicle-FA), which is recently also coined fixel-based FA (a fixel
 is a fiber element)

Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main objective is to setup a robust (to noise and crossing fibers) pipeline
 for the automatic extraction and statistical analysis of track-specific
 white matter measures.
 Estimated fixel-based orientations and metrics will be used as indirect
 proxies to axon loss, demyelination and neuroinflammation.
 In particular, the fixel-based RD (fixel-RD) could help to account for
 demyelination

\end_inset

.
 In order to achieve this, there are two main problems that have to be addressed
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fast, accurate and robust to noise and fiber crossing voxel-wise estimation
 of fixel-based metrics in diffusion MRI signal using the multi-tensor based
 method MRDS.
 This demands to improve the model selector step in MRDS to better estimate
 the number of tensors per voxel.
 Besides, parallelization of MRDS is necessary to ensure fast fitting of
 the MRDS method to the diffusion MRI signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multimetric analysis of white matter tracts in different fiber bundles.
 It's required to adapt the tractometry_flow pipeline to integrate the fixel-bas
ed MRDS metrics into the statistical analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although automating tract-profiling and metrics for white matter could improve
 brain connectivity mapping through crossing fiber regions and pathologies
 in the human brain, we will focus to demostrate the application of our
 pipeline to relapsing remitting MS with a unique acquisition paradigm of
