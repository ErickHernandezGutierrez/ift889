During the last years, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has established
 itself in clinical imaging and research because it is capable of imaging
 different physical properties of living tissue in a non-invasive and non-ionizi
ng way.
 There is a modality of MRI called diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI), or also
 called diffusion MRI (dMRI), that exploits the natural motion of water
 molecules undergoing Brownian motion in living biological tissues.
 Applied to human brain, it allows to infer the microscopic structure of
 the brain.

Back in time, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 was proposed the first a pulsed gradient spin-echo (SE) sequence.
 To study the displacement of the water molecules inside the brain, diffusion
 have to be linked to the signal intensity measured in MRI.
 Thus, two additional diffusion gradient pulses were added to the original
 SE sequence.
 The first of the two gradient pulses in this sequence introduces a phase
 shift that is dependent on the strength of the gradient at the position
 of the spin at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 After that a 
\begin_inset Formula $180Â°$
\end_inset

 RF pulse is applied to reverse the phase shift induced by the first gradient
 pulse.
 Ultimately, a second gradient pulse is applied to induce a phase shift
 dependent on the spin position at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\Delta$
\end_inset

.
 The first diffusion-encoding gradient causes the phase shift to vary with
 position.
 After the second diffusion-encoding gradient is applied, all spins that
 did not move will return to the their initial state.
 Therefore, if we measure the signal after the second gradient, we will
 get a high intensity signal because spins are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in-phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, resulting in a bright pixel.
 On the other hand, if the spins have moved, they will subjected to a different
 field strength during the second pulse and therefore will not return to
 the initial state, causing a decreased intensity of the measured signal.
 The longer the displacement along a gradient direction, the lower the signal
 intensity.

 Two diffusion-encoding gradient (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{diff}$
\end_inset

 or also denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$

 phase shift proportional to molecular displacement along the gradient direction.

 is the gyro-magnetic ratio; thus, it represents the effective diffusion

It is possible to represent a diffusion gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$
\end_inset

 as a 3D vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=\gamma\delta\mathbf{g}/2\pi$
\end_inset

 whose orientation is in the direction of diffusion and its length is proportion
al to the gradient strength.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 allows to navigate in the 3D diffusion space called 
\series bold
q-space
\series default
 and denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}^{3}$
\end_inset

, which the coordinates are defined by the frequency wave vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 with norm 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\left\Vert \mathbf{q}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $mm^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The gradient strength, also called diffusion weighting, is usually expressed
 in term of the 
\series bold
b-value
\series default
, which is responsible of tuning the diffusion attenuation.
 It is commonly denoted with 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $b=t\left\Vert \mathbf{q}\right\Vert ^{2}$
\end_inset

 (proportional to the gradient strength and the diffusion time interval)
 and measured in 
\begin_inset Formula $s/mm^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the measured diffusion signal 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

, or in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}$

 Applying sequences by varying the strength and direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 allows data sampling of the q-space.
 In most cases, a reference image 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 is taken.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 image does not have any diffusion sensitization, i.e.
 the strength of the diffusion gradient is zero (
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset

).
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a standard SE image.

Finally and in general, the signal

 Assuming Gaussian diffusion, DTI builds the apparent water self-diffusion
 tensor at each voxel.
 The structure of the tensor allows to infer the orientation of the diffusion
 compartments within the voxel.
 For example, the major eigenvector of the tensor is parallel to the principal
 fiber orientation, see Figure

 Water molecules diffusion along fibers.
 The diffusion tensor model captures this orientated diffusion process with
 the diffusion ellip- soid.
 Here, the FA of the illustrated tensor is approximately 0.7.
 The tensor can also be oblate if the first two eigenvalues are equal or
 spherical if all three are equal.

where

 The largest eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 gives the the Principal Diffusion Direction (PDD) of the tensor.
 The rest of the eigenvectors determinate the orthogonal planes to it, see

 These eigenvectors and eigenvalues not only determinate the shape of the
 tensor, but they are closely related to brain tissue properties.
 For example, the largest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the Axial Diffusivity (AD), while 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\lambda_{2}+\lambda_{3}}{2}$
\end_inset

 give information about the Radial Diffusivity (RD).
 Besides, from the diffusion tensor eigenvalues, several spherical measures
 can be extracted such as the

iffusivity (MD) or the

nisotropy (FA), among others.
 Both are given by

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
MD=\frac{\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}+\lambda_{3}}{3}, &  & FA=\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\left(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{3}\right)^{2}+\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}\right)^{2}}{\lambda_{1}^{2}+\lambda_{1}^{2}+\lambda_{1}^{2}}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Regardless of these measures have been widely used in publications within
 the field, it is important to note that the Gaussian diffusion assumption
 implies that there can only be a single fascicle per voxel.
 Thus, metrics maps resulting from DTI have one single value per voxel.
 An extension of these metrics to handle multiple fascicles will be discussed
 later in Chapter 2, and they constitute an essential component of this
 work.

maging (HARDI) was coined for this particular sampling strategy.
 HARDI is very similar in nature to the standard sampling for DTI.
 However, HARDI involves a larger number of unique diffusion-weighting gradient
 directions.
 Moreover, HARDI is not always a spherical sampling, but there also exists
 more sampling schemes of the 3D diffusion space, see Figure .
 For example,

HARDI was originally proposed to address the limitation of DTI for solving
 crossing fiber configurations.
 It is frequently accompanied of reconstruction methods more sophisticated
 than DTI, see Section

.
 In fact, some methods require a specually designed HARDI acquisition strategy

.
 Overall, it may be said that HARDI is not only important for solving the
 crossing fiber problem, but also for improving tractography, providing
 anisotropy metrics beyond FA and, therefore, for obtaining a reliable tractomet
ry analysis as we will describe in the incoming sections.

Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI)

 is a MRI technique that employs the diffusion propagator 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to describe the diffusion process in each voxel.
 It uses Fourier relationship between a, sufficient dense, cartesian sample
 of the signal 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 in the q-space and the diffusion probability density function such that
\end_layout

\]

\end_inset

where

Q-Ball Imaging

\begin_layout Standard
The Q-Ball Imaging (QBI) is a method that employ the Funk-Radon transform
 (FRT) on HARDI derived data to obtain a diffusion ODF (dODF)
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{q}}=\mathbf{q}/q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{Q}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 FRT uses the fact that the diffusion signal 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(\hat{\mathbf{q}},t\right)$
\end_inset

 is maximal in the directions perpendicular to the underlying fascicles,
 see Figure

 The dODF can properly represent the presence and orientation of multiple
 crossing fascicles.
 However, the resulted dODF is artificially smooth and inflated compared
 to the true diffusion ODF.
 Problematically, this same feature causes QBI to poorly distinguish fibers
 crossing at tight angles.
 Some modifications and generalizations to QBI have been published to try
 to achieve most of the QBI limitations

 Assuming a particular response function, the deconvolution will remove
 the âblurryâ part of the diffusion ODF to obtain a sharp fiber ODF that
 better captures the underlying fiber populations.
 Hence, a better angular resolution can be obtained, as illustrated in

The number of fascicles to be estimated is determined by the approximation

 MRDS is a general framework for estimating parameters in a multi-compartment

 Besides,

 represents the axial (

 The PDD

On the whole, one of the main challenges in building accurate models is
 to find a balance between the complexity and the number of parameters of
 the model.
 Models with few parameters have a low level of complexity and are easier
 to fit.
 However, these models tend to underfit the data because they do not have
 enough flexibility to capture variations in the diffusion signal.
 On the other hand, high complexity models are more capable of capturing
 variations in the diffusion signal and 
\end_layout

have many parameters to tune and tend to overfit the data.

 from the diffusion tensor

 In particular, the PDD of the tensor is used as it is linked to the maximum
 diffusion direction, see Figure

 Additionally, it is necessary to define when streamlines have to finish
 propagating.
 For this, a termination criterion is required.
 In some algorithms, streamlines propagation terminates when they reach
 a region with low anisotropy like gray matter, where there is no coherent
 direction to follow.
 Thus, a FA threshold is set to determine when streamlines are in an isotropic
 region.
 Typically, that threshold for tracking termination is set equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

 as FA in the gray matter is in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0.1,0.2\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, there are more termination criterion that can considered,
 for example, the angle change between pixels.

 Furthermore, several alternative tractography algorithms have been proposed,
 and they can be cataloged in different families.

It is important to remark that streamlines do not represent real axonal
 tracts, but they represent the most plausible path of water diffusion.
 Besides, tractography is sensitive to the chosen tracking algorithm, i.e.
 quantitative analyses may be affected by the underlying algorithm or the
 parameters (seeds, stop criterion, etc.).
 Taking everything into account, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions
 on brain connectivity or brain functions.

Phantoms

Either in neuroscience research or clinical applications, validation is
 a requirement.
 Estimation of the fiber tracts and tissue profiles is extremely challenging.
 Besides, it is well-known that there is no in-vivo data with a real ground
 truth (GT) that could be used for validation.
 An extensively and successfully substitute for in-vivo GT is the use of
 synthetic phantoms.
 They constitute a controllable scenario that provides precise information
 of the underlying microstructural properties (e.g.
 local fiber orientation, geometrical configuration of fiber tracts, tissue
 properties, etc.).
 There are plenty of phantoms in the state-of-the-art that serve as validation
 tools for quantitatively and qualitatively evaluation of the performance
 of tractography

Digital Phantoms

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to physical phantoms, digital phantoms - also called numerical
 phantoms - are digital objects generated with a computer software.
 They consist of multiple components: (1) A structure model defining the
 simulated fiber configuration, (2) a diffusion model describing the water
 diffusion in the structural model, which determinates the signal attenuation
 in the diffusion-weighted signal, and (3) an algorithm that simulates the
 signal using the previous two components.

Both physical and digital phantoms have their own advantages and limitations
 according to the use-cases.
 The most important difference between them is that even with a well defined
 physical phantom, it is not possible to provide such a perfect ground truth
 because of, for example, mechanical limitations or the statistical nature
 of the diffusion process 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Hence, digital phantoms are the only way to obtain a dMRI data with a real
 ground truth.
 That's why we have decided to use a digital phantom for this work.
 We will discuss the selected phantom in the next chapter.

Multiple Sclerosis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common neurological disease that affects primarily
 young adults.
 Usually, persons between the ages of 15 and 50 (average of 30) are affected
 by MS.
 It is present 2-3 times more often in women rather than men.
 However, the reasons are still unclear.
 MS begins with episodic attacks of neurological symptoms.
 Then some years later, it enters in a progressive phase.
 MS may have different stages after the first symptoms appear.
 For example, a 
\series bold
relapsing-remitting
\series default
 stage, which consists of attacks and remissions of symptoms.
 Many patients will later make the transition to a 
\series bold
secondary-progressive
\series default
 stage or they could begin with a 
\series bold
primary-progressive
\series default
 stage with slow progression without attacks.
 Recently, there has been some patients that began as progressive, but later
 they have one or more acute relapses.
 These cases are called 
\series bold
progressive-relapsing
\series default
 type of the MS disease.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the cause of MS is unclear, it is well-known that MS is not a 1-factor
 disease, but multiple factors are involved.
 Some factors like genetics (e.g.
 HLA DRB1*15:01), environmental (e.g.
 low vitamin D levels) and lifestyle (e.g.
 cigarette smoking) contribute to the development of MS.

Inflammatory processes in the Central Nervous System (CNS) characterized
 by breakdown in the myelin that surrounds axon nerves.
 Breakdowns in the blood-brain barriers allows immunologically active cells
 in the blood to enter the brain and cause patchy damage to myelin.
 These scattered circumscribed lesions are called 
\series bold
plaques
\series default
 and cause the symptoms of MS slowing or disrupting conduction in the axons
 as myelin is necessary for the conduction in myelinated nerves.
 The plaques are characterized by inflammation, demyelination and scarring
 (
\series bold
gliosis
\series default
).
 Some axons can remyelinate again causing some remissions after an attack.

.
 The dMRI showing lesions in some areas, and the spinal fluid tests are
 helpful in diagnosing MS.
 However, they do not correlate with specific symptoms.
 That's why they are not used to follow the course of the disease once the
 diagnosis has been made.
 More importantly, they do not make themselves the diagnosis because similar
 changes can occur on other conditions.
 Finally, the presence of characteristic changes on the dMRI images raised
 a massive number of studies and analyses.

Different imaging features in MS.
 (A, B) Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) shows typical
 appearance of deep WM plaques like multiple hyperintense lesions in subcortical
 and cerebral deep WM, mostly ovoid in shape.
 (C, D) Sagittal FLAIR shows demyelinating plaques along the margin of lateral
 ventricles and the corpus callosum, with the typical radial arrangement,
 called Dawson fingers.
 Axial T1-weighted images before (E) and after (F) gadolinium administration
 show a single plaque in the right frontal lobe, which shows enhancement
 after contrast injection, consistent acute inflammatory demyelination.
 (G) Diffusion-weighted imaging reveals a high signal lesion, which may
 be related to the acute phase of the disease.
