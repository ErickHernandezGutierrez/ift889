Robust Estimation of Fixed-FA on Fiber Crossing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this abstract, we proposed a multi-shell pipeline based on MRDS to estimate
 the fixel-FA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It was shown that this method is accurate and robust to noise in synthetic
 phantoms, and in the centrum semiovale of the human brain with clinical
 multi-shell data sets.
 This method does not involve tractography, but instead it uses the local
 model to recover the different bundles clustering tensors with a similarity
 function.
 The pipeline is similar to the one described in Figure

The bundle segmentation step uses the dissimilarity measure described in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "diisimilarity-measure"

\end_inset

, which defines a distance function between two tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 such that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)=\frac{\left\Vert p\left(\mathbf{D}\right)-p\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\right\Vert }{d_{0}^{2}}+\frac{\angle\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)}{\theta_{0}}+\frac{\left|fa\left(\mathbf{D}\right)-fa\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\right|}{f_{0}}+\frac{\left|md\left(\mathbf{D}\right)-md\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\right|}{m_{0}},\label{eq:dissimilarity-function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where defined 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

 are constants, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\mathbf{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the voxel position of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\angle\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the PDDs of the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $fa\left(\mathbf{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $md\left(\mathbf{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 are the FA and MD values of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{D}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Then, a similarity function is defined as following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)=exp\left(-d\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)\right).\label{eq:similarity-function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The segmentation of the bundles is performed using a flood-fill based algorithm.
 Given an random initial tensor, the algorithm starts the bundle in the
 voxel containing that tensor.
 Then, it looks for all the tensors in the neighboring voxels.
 If a neighbor voxel contains a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{T}\right)>c$
\end_inset

, for some fixed threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, the algorithm extends the bundle to that voxel.
 After that, the process is recursively repeated for the new voxels in the
 bundle, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, a filtering step is used to enhance the overall FA values of each
 bundle by using the information obtained in the segmentation stage.
 Given the separated bundles, the FA values of every tensor is averaged
 with the FA value of its tensor neighbors within the same bundle.
 This filtering step is helpful to remove the dispersion when estimating
 the FA value for each tensor by keeping the local spatial properties.
 This pipeline was tested on the digital phantom introduced in the previous
 chapter.
 We set the FA values different for each bundle.
 For bundle 1, 
\begin_inset Formula $FA\sim0.8$
\end_inset

 with a damaged spot where 
\begin_inset Formula $FA\sim0.6$
\end_inset

 simulating a localized damaged in the bundle.
 For bundle 2, 
\begin_inset Formula $FA\sim0.85$
\end_inset

 simulating a healthy bundle and, for bundle 3, 
\begin_inset Formula $FA\sim0.6$
\end_inset

 simulating a completely damaged bundle.
 Finally, Rician noise with 
\begin_inset Formula $SNR=12$
\end_inset

 was added using Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the in-vivo data set, we used one of the control subjects of the myelo_infe
rno data set and the centrum semiovale as ROI.

 Moreover, it can be observed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:flood-fill-results"

\end_inset

 that the pipeline allows for an accurate estimation of the fixel-FA profile
 in both synthetic and in-vivo dMRI data.
 From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:flood-fill-results"

\end_inset

 it is easy to identify which bundle is healthy, partially damaged or globally
 damaged.
 The pipeline is robust to fiber crossing and high level of noise.
 However, this pipeline requires to manually tune a large number of parameters
 (
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

).
 Altogether, this pipeline showed that MRDS has potential to be combined
 with more sophisticated methods for fiber tracking like tractography.
 Thereby making it well suited to the goal of automatically estimating fiber
 tract profiles by using tractometry.

This abstract evidenced that the multi-tensor fields fitted by MRDS can
 adapted to be included in a standard tractography technique.
 That's why it marked an important previous results for out current work
 because it could replace, for our pipeline, the CSD as local modeling in
 Tractoflow.
 However, the current state of the model selector in MRDS prevents to use
 MRDS as it causes plenty of false positive streamlines.
 But it opened the question to improve the model selector in MRDS.

 Shaders use the tensor matrix to deform and color sphere glyphs on the
 GPU to get diffusion tensor glyphs for DTI.
 It supports MTM glyphs as layers of standard DTI glyphs.

 maps, see Figure

 we excluded a tractography process.
 In this way, we focus on results arising from the capability of MRDS to
 estimate the fixel-based dMRI metrics.
 In other words, we will study the results of the tractometry pipeline assuming
 that we have a GT tractogram without false positives, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:GT-tractogram"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, we remove any bias induced by false positives to see the best possible
 scenario for the pipeline in terms of the fixel-based metrics estimation.

 shows the tract profiles for the 
\begin_inset Formula $26$
\end_inset

 healthy control subjects over the 
\begin_inset Formula $3$

 bundles.
 Estimated metrics correspond to the GT metrics of the phantom as we showed
 in Figure

.
 One have to keep in mind that level of noise used in the input DWI is 
\begin_inset Formula $SNR=12$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, our results suggest that our pipeline is robust to high level of
 noise variations.
 After having validated our pipeline on the control data set, we applied
 the pipeline to the damaged phantom data set on the 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 synthetic fascicles, where phantoms have a damaged spot around the crossing
 of the bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 as shown in Figure

 demonstrates that the pipeline effectively identify decreases in AD and
 FA, and increases in RD and MD.
 Those changes in RD values correspond to the location of the simulated
 demyelination of the bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of per bundle statistics, we also note from Figure

 that results for healthy bundles show similar results.
 This gives indications that MRDS is robust against the fiber crossing.

 have several aggressive valleys in the tract profiles, which is consequence
 of the unrealistic shape of the bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

.
 As we explained in the last chapter, tratometry_flow computes the centroid
 of all the input bundles.
 However, the circular shape of the bundle results, for locations along
 the streamline, in a null centroid.
 This should not be a problem in in-vivo data as there are not tracts with
 circular shape in the human brain.
 In summary, the results are promising on synthetic data, with the pipeline
 identifying anomalies in concordance with the damage in the bundles while
 being accurate and robust to noise.
