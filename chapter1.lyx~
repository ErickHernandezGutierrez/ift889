Preface

\begin_layout Standard
The potential of the combination between diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
 (diffusion MRI) and tractography in research and clinical neuroscience
 has been illustrated in a vast number of times

.
 There are plenty of applications such as quantitative comparisons of specific
 white matter pathways in disease, getting insights about normal brain anatomy
 in order to understand the consequences of localised pathology or guide
 interventions and gaining evidence for the presence of qualitatively different
 pathways in congenital disorders or following damage recovery

.
 Other important applications involve tractography with the development
 of human connectome-based atlases for surgical approaches

Although tractography has proved its effectiveness, it has a large incidence
 of erroneous streamline trajectories also called 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{false}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{positive}$
\end_inset

 streamlines.
 No matter which tracking algorithm or approach we take there are always
 presence of false positives in tractography.
 These wrong streamlines do not represent an anatomical reality.
 Recent studies have highlighted that the large number of false positive
 streamlines can lead to misrepresent any connectivity analysis

.
 The COMMIT framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Daducci"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has proved to be a powerful tool to prune tractograms from false-postives
 streamlines, see Figure [

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

].
 Unlike other methods, COMMIT does not consider tractography and tissue
 micro-structure estimation as two separated problems.
 Instead, it combines tractography with local micro-structural features
 in order to make a selection of the best subset of streamlines that best
 fit the dMRI signal.
 However, in its original formulation and implementation, the COMMIT framework
 has some limitations estimating axon caliber.
 COMMIT also suffers from high memory usage when storing precalculated synthetic
 MR signals.

 They are visually compared to those recovered by the state-of-the-art global
 tracking algorithm GIBBS (top).

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis introduces a regularized and accelerated formulation for the
 COMMIT model.
 Here we extend the COMMIT model with a Tikhonov's regularization term added
 to the original formulation to improve the estimation of axon caliber with
 COMMIT.
 Memory constraints have been addressed by proposing a new sampling scheme
 for the half-sphere discretization in COMMIT.
 We exhibit significant reduction in memory usage as well as speedups for
 model fitting.
 Besides, we demostrate improvements in the axon diameter distribution estimatio
n without decreasing accuracy in the fitting of the measured diffusion MR
 signal.
 For validation of our method, we use synthetic MRI phantom signals and
 the real brain dataset used for the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is composed by 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 chapters and one appendix.
 This first chapter represents the storyline linking the different chapters
 together.
 This chapter have general information for introducing the reader to the
 context and background of the thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 introduces the basic terminology and concepts behind diffusion MRI and
 brain tractography.
 Then, it reviews the COMMIT model and its implementation as a framework,
 which is the fundamental starting point for the thesis.
 Additionally, we also discuss two important limitations of the COMMIT framework.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, we describe the methods, which offer potential improvements over the limitatio
ns in the COMMIT framework.
 We provide information and details about the implementation.
 Some of the algorithms of the Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 are located in the appendix.
 The remaining chapters move into the experiments, results, conclusions
 and future work.
 We first, in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

, describe the experiments designed in order to validate the obtained results
 and we present the obtained results of these experiments.
 Finally, in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods as well as
 the areas of improvement of our work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our work is intended for anyone who is interested in understanding or modifying
 the COMMIT framework for performing efficient microstructure informed tractogra
phy.
 We expect that the reader has elementary knowledge in linear algebra.
 The mathematical level of this book is modest as the reader only requires
 the basics about matrix manipulation.
 Previous exposure to the Python programming language is not required, but
 it is useful in case the reader wants to modify the COMMIT framework.
